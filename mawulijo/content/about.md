## Profile
I am a full stack web and mobile developer and systems administrator based in Accra, Ghana.

I have been building websites and applications for the past two years and I graduated with my first degree from [Switzerland Management Center University (SMCU)][IT-Sec] with a Bachelor in IT-Security (BBA). I am currently pursuing my second degree in BSc. (Hons) Computer Science at [Regent University College of Science and Technology][BSc-CS]

I have worked with the [Electricity Company of Ghana][ECG] for the since 2011 as an IT Assistant. My work in the company has helped in shaping me to be a well rounded human resource since my schedules traverse into other departments such as Engineering, Finance, Human Resources, just to name a few.

I am a strong advocate of Open-source software and an aspiring contributor to the community.

In my spare time I like to create my own websites to keep up with the latest web technologies and I also like playing soccer and teaching others about web development.

## Interests
- Passionate about technology inside and outside of my professional life.
- Self-taught in Web Development. Projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mawulijo).
- Regularly provide pro-bono web development to charities and startups.
- Playing football, reading, traveling and listening to music.

## Current setup
My current hardware setup is as follows:

- Late 2013 13" Retina Macbook Pro with windows 10
    * No dual boot. Running windows natively
- Two Hp 27" monitors
- Hp Pro Mini-Tower desktop PC with Windows 10

## About this website
The idea behind this website is in twofold, to give a quick overview of my skills and experience and a place to keep knowledge of my projects/assignments during my Computer Science Course at [RUCST][RUCST].

It was built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator which embodies these principles of engineering that I adhere to - simplicity, elegance, performance and openness.
