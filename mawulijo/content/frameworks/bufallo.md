## What is it?
[Bufullo](http://gobuffalo.io) aims to make building new web applications in Go as quick and simple as possible, and what could be more simple than a new application generator?

## What is it like?
EOne of the downsides to Go development is the lack of code "reloading". This means as you change your code you need to manually stop your application, rebuild it, and then restart it. Buffalo finds this is annoying, and wants to make life better for you.

It is [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) for [Go](https://golang.org) as django is for python. Ruby on Rails devs will feel at home with it.
