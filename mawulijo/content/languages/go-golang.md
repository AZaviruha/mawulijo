## What is it?
[Go](https://golang.org) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

## What is it like?
**Go** is recognizably in the tradition of **C**, but makes many changes to improve brevity, simplicity, and safety. Go consists of,

* A syntax and environment adopting patterns more common in dynamic languages:
* Optional concise variable declaration and initialization through type inference 

```go
    go (x := 0 not int x = 0; or var x = 0;)
```
* Fast compilation times.
* Remote package management (go get) and online package documentation.
* Distinctive approaches to particular problems:
* Built-in concurrency primitives: light-weight processes (goroutines), channels, and the select statement.
* A desire to keep the language specification simple enough to hold in a programmer's head, in part by omitting features common to similar languages.
