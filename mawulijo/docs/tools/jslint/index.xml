      <description>The brief This is a package I wrote and used in several of my projects. It offers slide/swipe functionality for content inside a carousel.
I wanted to create a slider that was lightweight and simple for others to integrate into their projects.
I also wanted it to be fast and responsive so it would behave itself when the browser window was resized.
Project planning There were existing slider modules available, but they all required third party packages such as jQuery.</description>
